    <textOnly>WARNING



Your merchant wants to pass the Language test, but we have no email address to send it. Please create a contact and manually send this template :



“Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of your onboarding process on Back Market, would you be interested in completing our language test? If so, great! This email is for you.


We will ask you for your Unique ID (P.K.) so that we can identify you and associate your answers with your merchant account.


To the question “What is your P.K.?” you will need to answer {!Account.Back_Office_PK__c}.


It is vital that you fill in the correct number, otherwise we will not be able to retrieve your answers.


You can access the language test by clicking here.


Good luck with the test and have a great day,

{!User.Name},

Back Market
