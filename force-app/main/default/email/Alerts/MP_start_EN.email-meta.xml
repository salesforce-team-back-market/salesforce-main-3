    <textOnly>Hello {!Alert__c.Business_Name__c},

This email is intended to inform you that your recent quality performance on Back Market, in particular the &quot;{!Alert__c.Issue_KPI__c}&quot; rate, does not meet the quality standards outlined in article 12 of Back Marketâ€™s T&amp;Cs and in the Quality Charter. As such, your account is entering a monitoring period.

The purpose of this monitoring period is to enable you to reach an objective and meet the  expected quality standards before {!Alert__c.ETA__c}.  In the event that your quality performance does not improve by this date, your sales will automatically be limited. For more information about monitoring period thresholds, please check the Merchant Support Center.

Your Back Market contact is available to work with you to analyze the situation and jointly build an action plan to address issues.

Having said that, we hope that no limitation is needed as we view your account as a valuable partner on the platform. Please reach out with any additional questions.

Sincerely,

Back Market
