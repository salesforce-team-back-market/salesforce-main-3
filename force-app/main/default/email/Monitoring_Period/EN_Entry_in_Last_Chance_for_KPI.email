Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I have been alerted again that your "{!Alert__c.Issue_KPI__c}" rate is unfortunately still not meeting the objective that had been fixed. We had defined an action plan to reduce your rate from XXX to X% before {!Alert__c.ETA__c}.

Unfortunately, this situation put you in the "last chance" phase of our Monitoring Period and your sales have been limited. From now on, weâ€™ll work even harder on this KPI in order to lift your sales limitation and ensure an optimal customer experience. 

The objective remains the same (i.e. X%) and must be reached before the end of this last chance period, i.e. before {!Alert__c.ETA__c}.

In order to assist you in this task, I am attaching to this email the list of after sales requests that have negatively impacted your rate over the last 30 days.

Here are the new solutions I can offer you:




Of course, I remain available to discuss this over the phone and accompany you in your action plan.

Wishing you a very nice day,
